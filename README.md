# Name: Module 3 Challenge (Customer Banking System)

## Description

This is one of the challenges from the UNC/EDx AI Bootcamp course. The Customer Banking challenge provided multiple starter python files. I needed to use classes across different files to allow the main functionality to work and display savings account and CD account results based on user entry of balance, interest and time(months).

Re-submitted this challenge where I used the interest formula provided in the challenge hints. 

## Usage
The functionality allows users to enter CD and Savings account information to project the future balances based on the information they provided. 

## Project Status

Completed.
