# Name: Module 3 Challenge (Customer Banking System)

## Description

This is one of the challenges from the UNC/EDx AI Bootcamp course. The Customer Banking challenge provided multiple starter python files. I needed to use classes across different files to allow the main functionality to work and display savings account and CD account resuls based on user entry of balance, interest and time(months).

For the challenge, I wasn't sure if I interpreted what was requested correctly. I made some minor changes such as rearranging the order of interest earned vs the new balance as well as imported the classes rather than the function and added the class when passing the information from the main function. e.g. I added the 'CDAccount' piece to the already provided 'updated_cd_balance, interest_earned = CDAccount.create_cd_account(cd_balance, cd_interest, cd_maturity)'

## Usage
The functionality allows users to enter CD and Savings account information to project the future balances based on the information they provided. 

## Project Status

Completed.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to Peter, a high school math teacher, that helped me understand the math needed for the interest on bank accounts.
